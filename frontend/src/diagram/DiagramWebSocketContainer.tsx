/**
 * Here be dragons!
 *
 * If you want to modify this component, you need to understand this documentation first and foremost.
 * Any change to this component which involve a change to the reducer, its machine or one of the useEffect
 * functions will REQUIRE an update to this documentation. The lifecycle of this component is not perfect
 * and it can still be dramatically improved. Yet, we have currently a stable situation which can be
 * documented.
 *
 * This component can be in one of four states:
 * - EMPTY__STATE
 * - LOADING__STATE
 * - READY__STATE
 * - COMPLETE__STATE
 *
 * Almost a dozen variables are involved to determine whether or not we should transition from one state
 * to another. The EMPTY__STATE is used to represent a state where this component is blank and not
 * connected to any GraphQL subscription. In this state, the component is not even connected to a specific
 * representation. This state is temporary and will not persist for long since immediatly after starting
 * from this state, we will transition to the LOADING__STATE. This first state is thus used in order to
 * trigger the initial transition of the state machine in a similar fashion as some future transitions.
 *
 * From the LOADING__STATE, the component will have only one goal, to perform the initialization of the
 * diagram server. Once initialized the component will move to the READY__STATE. In the READY__STATE, we
 * will start the GraphQL subscription and listen to diagram events coming from the server. In this state,
 * the various callbacks defined in this component and used by our Sprotty code can be used safely.
 *
 * If we receive a connection error while starting the GraphQL subscription or if we encounter a GraphQL-WS
 * error or complete message, we will move to the COMPLETE__STATE. In this state, we know that the diagram
 * being displayed cannot be displayed anymore. The diagram has simply been deleted by someone (the current
 * user or another user) or the diagram has never existed (if someone has entered an invalid URL for example).
 * In this case, we will carefully remove the Sprotty diagram from the component (see more about that in a
 * large comment below). Once in the COMPLETE__STATE, we will only be able to perform one transition, switching
 * to another representation. Such transition will make us switch to the LOADING__STATE to wait for the
 * initialization of a new diagram server instance.
 *
 * Here are some use cases showing how the component should react:
 *
 * 1/ Manipulating diagrams
 *
 * In the default use case, a user will open a diagram, view it and iteract with it. For that, we will
 * start in the EMPTY__STATE, once a first empty rendering has been done and the React ref has been
 * initialized, we will move to the initialization of the diagram server. When the diagram server has
 * been initialized, we will start the GraphQL subscription.
 *
 * When we will receive some data, the user will finally be able to see a diagram on screen and interact
 * with it. Most of the work of a user will be done in this READY__STATE. From there, we have a working
 * diagram server ready to interact with Sprotty.
 *
 * +-----------------+                                +-------------------+                                        +-----------------+
 * |                 |                                |                   |                                        |                 |
 * |   EMPTY STATE   +---[SWITCHING REPRESENTATION]-->|   LOADING STATE   +---[INITIALIZING THE DIAGRAM SERVER]--->|   READY STATE   |
 * |                 |                                |                   |                                        |                 |
 * +-----------------+                                +-------------------+                                        +-----------------+
 *
 * 2/ Switching between diagrams
 *
 * When we will switch from one diagram to another using either our tabs, the explorer or by changing the
 * URL. First, we will have a diagram loaded by the user (see the previous section) so here we will start
 * with the READY__STATE. Switching to another diagram will make us initialize everything once again from
 * scratch. This new initialization step is required in order to have the proper representationId in the
 * closure of our callbacks used by Sprotty to perform our mutations. While this could be simplified,
 * keep in mind that switching to another diagram requires initializing the diagram server.
 *
 * +-----------------+                                 +-------------------+                                        +-----------------+
 * |                 |                                 |                   |                                        |                 |
 * |   READY STATE   +---[SWITCHING REPRESENTATION]--->|   LOADING STATE   +---[INITIALIZING THE DIAGRAM SERVER]--->|   READY STATE   |
 * |                 |                                 |                   |                                        |                 |
 * +-----------------+                                 +-------------------+                                        +-----------------+
 *
 * Switching from one diagram to another or switching from no diagram to the first selected diagram are
 * thus performed in a similar way.
 *
 * 3/ Reacting to the diagram deletion
 *
 * When a diagram is deleted, the backend will send us a complete message indicating that we will never
 * ever receive anymore diagram refresh events for the diagram. Once that message has been received, we
 * will switch to the COMPLETE__STATE and remove the diagram from the interface.
 *
 * +-----------------+                                   +--------------------+
 * |                 |                                   |                    |
 * |   READY STATE   +---[RECEIVE A COMPLETE MESSAGE]--->|   COMPLETE STATE   |
 * |                 |                                   |                    |
 * +-----------------+                                   +--------------------+
 *
 * The same behavior would occur in case of an error or a connection error since those are errors we cannot
 * recover from.
 *
 * 4/ Switching to another diagram
 *
 * When we are working on a proper diagram and switching to a diagram which does not exist anymore or
 * when we are trying to open a deleted diagram, we will start from either the READY__STATE in case we
 * were viewing an existing diagram or from the COMPLETE__STATE if we were viewing a deleted or non-existent
 * diagram. In those situations, we will start by going back to the LOADING__STATE to wait for the diagram
 * server initialization.
 *
 * Once initialized, the diagram server will receive a complete message indicating that we will never ever
 * receive any diagram refresh event for the given representationId and thus that the diagram does not exist.
 * The server cannot distinguish a representation which has never existed and a representation which has
 * been deleted.
 *
 * The only way to properly deactivate Sprotty is both to remove the diagram server and to remove the base
 * div used to display the diagram. This div can only be removed by React thanks to a carefully arranged
 * organization. This behavior is documented later in this component.
 *
 * +-----------------+
 * |                 |
 * |   READY STATE   +------+
 * |                 |      |                                +-------------------+                                        +-----------------+
 * +-----------------+      |                                |                   |                                        |                 |
 *                          +--[SWITCHING REPRESENTATION]--->|   LOADING STATE   +---[INITIALIZING THE DIAGRAM SERVER]--->|   READY STATE   |
 * +--------------------+   |                                |                   |                                        |                 |
 * |                    |   |                                +-------------------+                                        +-----------------+
 * |   COMPLETE STATE   +---+
 * |                    |
 * +--------------------+
 *
 * Then after having reach the READY__STATE, we will receive a complete message in case we are trying to
 * view a diagram which does not exist or which has been deleted. Deleting a diagram by ourserlves, trying
 * to view a diagram deleted by another person or trying to view a diagram which has never existed are
 * exactly the same thing.
 *
 * 5/ Switching from a deleted diagram to another diagram
 *
 * If we are viewing a deleted diagram, we will have reach the COMPLETE__STATE. In order to display another
 * diagram, we will need to initialize the Sprotty base div once again. For that, we will need to display
 * it and connect it to React with useRef() once again. In order to perform that, we will need to move back
 * to the LOADING__STATE once again.
 *
 * +--------------------+                                 +-------------------+
 * |                    |                                 |                   |
 * |   COMPLETE STATE   +---[SWITCHING REPRESENTATION]--->|   LOADING STATE   |
 * |                    |                                 |                   |
 * +--------------------+                                 +-------------------+
 *
 * Once the diagram server has been initialized, we will either start receiving proper diagram data and thus
 * switch to the diagram loaded state or we will receive a complete message and switch back to the complete
 * state since we would have switched to another deleted diagram.
 *
 *
 * As you may have understood it, the lifecycle of this component has evolved organically due to the complexity
 * of managing multiple useEffect hooks, user interactions and Websocket messages. The current organization is
 * not perfect but some proper states are starting to emerge from this. We have something like six potentially
 * asynchronous processes to schedule properly with close to a dozen variables which should be in a proper state
 * in each situation. This is complex but it is getting better updates after updates for the moment.

   * Gather up, it's time for a story.
   *
   * Once upon a time, the following code was victim of a painful bug. The first version of the bug caused
   * some content to remain even after we told React to remove it. The issue was coming from the fact we
   * were giving control of one of our divs to Sprotty, the div with "ref={diagramElement}". Sprotty seems
   * to heavily modify this div, including it seems destroying it and recreating it. This is not unsurprising
   * since we told it that it is under its control.
   *
   * Now when we need to remove a diagram, because it does not exist anymore, we need to remove this content.
   * An issue arise because we told React to remove the div in question but React has kept a reference to
   * the original version of the div that it has rendered. Now Sprotty has replaced that div with a new one
   * and thus when React tries to delete the content it tries to remove a div from a parent div but the div
   * in question has been long gone from its parent. As a result, a DOMException occurred, warning us that
   * "the node to be removed is not a child of this node".
   *
   * In order to fix this issue, two intermediary divs have been introduced with the id "diagram-container"
   * and "diagram-wrapper". The goal of diagram container is to act as the stable React parent div from which
   * we will remove some content. The diagram wapper will act as the stable child div which will be removed
   * when the content is not available anymore. React does not seems to care that under this div there are
   * some content which is not under its control anymore. Telling React to delete the diagram wrapper will
   * make it drop the whole DOM subtree without looking precisely at its content. It's faster for React and
   * better for us since it allows us to fix our issue.
   *
   * And thus, those various divs lived long and happily ever after...
   *
   * TLDR: Do not touch the div structure below without a deep understanding of the React reconciliation algorithm!
